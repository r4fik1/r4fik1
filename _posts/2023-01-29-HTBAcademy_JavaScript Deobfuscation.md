## Module Summary

Many malicious actors tend to obfuscate their code to avoid it being detected by systems or understood by other developers.

The ability to deobfuscate code is a useful technique that can be applied to various real-world scenarios. It is useful on web application assessments to determine if a developer has used "security by obscurity" to hide JavaScript code containing sensitive data. It can also be useful for defenders when, for example, attempting to deobfuscate code that was responsible for the Phishing website used in an attack.

In this module, you will learn the basics of deobfuscating and decoding JavaScript code and will have several exercises to practice what you learned.

You will learn the following topics:

  - Locating JavaScript code
  - Intro to Code Obfuscation
  - How to Deobfuscate JavaScript code
  - How to decode encoded messages
  - Basic Code Analysis
  - Sending basic HTTP requests
  
Our final exercise in this module will open a door for many other challenges and exercises in Hack The Box!

## Source Code

>*Q. Repeat what you learned in this section, and you should find a secret flag, what is it?

## Deobfuscation

>*Q. Using what you learned in this section, try to deobfuscate 'secret.js' in order to get the content of the flag. What is the flag?

## HTTP Requests

>*Q. As you may have noticed, the JavaScript code is obfuscated. Try applying the skills you learned in this module to deobfuscate the code, and retrieve the 'flag' variable.

## Decoding

>*Q. Using what you learned in this section, determine the type of encoding used in the string you got at previous exercise, and decode it. To get the flag, you can send a 'POST' request to 'serial.php', and set the data as "serial=YOUR_DECODED_OUTPUT".

## Skills Assessment

>*Q. Try to study the HTML code of the webpage, and identify used JavaScript code within it. What is the name of the JavaScript file being used?

>*Q. Once you find the JavaScript code, try to run it to see if it does any interesting functions. Did you get something in return?

>*Q. As you may have noticed, the JavaScript code is obfuscated. Try applying the skills you learned in this module to deobfuscate the code, and retrieve the 'flag' variable.
